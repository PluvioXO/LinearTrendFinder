Generally pretty skeptical of this project. More so a proof of conscept I have. I feel like for n < 10 timeseries datasets this methodology looses all effectiveness however where n >> 10 it takes over. 

I have a couple ideas like looking at covariance as a method instead of fit to a regression line so I am just planning to play around and see what happens.
